If cube_1 is currently grasped (is_grasped(cube_1) is true) AND cube_1 is not yet stably placed in its goal (is_cube_1_in_goal is false), then cube_1 is the active cube. 2. Else if cube_2 is currently grasped (is_grasped(cube_2) is true) AND cube_2 is not yet stably placed in its goal (is_cube_2_in_goal is false), then cube_2 is the active cube. 3. Else if both cube_1 and cube_2 are not yet stably placed in their goals: a. If distance(robot_gripper_pos, cube_1_pos) < distance(robot_gripper_pos, cube_2_pos), then cube_1 is the active cube. b. Else, cube_2 is the active cube. 4. Else if only cube_1 is not yet stably placed in its goal, then cube_1 is the active cube. 5. Else if only cube_2 is not yet stably placed in its goal, then cube_2 is the active cube. 6. Else (both cubes are stably placed), there is no active cube for stage progression.
